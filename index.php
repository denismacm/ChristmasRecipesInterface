                            I believe that Christmas can be celebrated anytime during any season. Like, what's wrong with listening to "All I Want for Christmas Is You" by Mariah Carey
                            in July? Or keeping the Christmas decorations up until February?
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Thus, this all-in-one Christmas Recipes interface allows you to not only search, edit, and delete authors' Christmas recipes, but also
                            add your own, during any time of the year! You can find the most delicious Christmas recipes to stand out at every festivity you attend. 
                            It is highly recommended that you browse through others' recipes first before you add your own.
                        </p>
