# ChristmasRecipesInterface

## Topic & Purpose
My website is an interface of a collection of Christmas recipes with the encouragement of
participating in making these recipes and posting new ones during any time of the year.
The purpose is to help users create new Christmas recipes to stand out at any festive occasion
that they attend.

## Source
My data was collected from a public dataset on Kaggle, entitled "Christmas Recipes" by Gary
Broughton. The dataset was last updated four years ago but links the recipes to a working site,
BBC Good Food. I truncated the data from over 1,600 recipes to 300, and assigned each recipe a
food type. The source of the data is in JSON format, so I manipulated the data into an Excel table
to insert it into MySQL tables, where I was able to normalize the data.
